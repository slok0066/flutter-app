   - Clear Gradle cache: `./gradlew clean`
   - Update Gradle wrapper if needed

3. **Permission issues**
   - Some permissions require manual user approval
   - Usage stats permission needs system settings access

   - More detailed error messages and debugging

2. **Simplify dependencies**
   - Remove problematic plugins temporarily
   - Build core functionality first
   - Add advanced features incrementally
